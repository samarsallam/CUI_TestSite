- title: "EduCUI: The First International Workshop for Conversational User Interfaces in Education"
  datetime: 8th July 2024 (Time TBC)
  organisers: Justin Edwards, Adelson de Araujo, Smit Desai, Jan de Wit, Heloisa Candello, Daniel John Rough, Leigh Clark, Anni-Sofia Roberts, and Benjamin Cowan
  description: EduCUI aims to connect the Conversational User Interfaces (CUI) and the learning sciences and educational technologies (EduTech) communities through discussion of their shared view of the future of conversational user interfaces in educational contexts. The workshop aims to encourage creative consideration of the trade-offs in design and cross-disciplinary expertise needed for designing CUIs for education

-  title: "Designing Age-Inclusive Interfaces: Emerging Mobile, Conversational, and Generative AI to Support Interactions across the Life Span"
   datetime: 8th July 2024 (Time TBC)
   organisers: Sayan Sarcar, Cosmin Munteanu, Jaisie Sin, Christina Wei, Sergio Sayago, Wei Zhao, and Jenny Waycott
   description: "We are concurrently witnessing two significant shifts: voice and chat-based conversational user interfaces (CUIs) are becoming ubiquitous (especially more recently due to advances in generative AI and LLMs - large language models), and older people are becoming a very large demographic group (and increasingly adopting of mobile technology on which such interfaces are present). However, despite the recent increase in research activity, age-relevant and inter/cross-generational aspects continue to be underrepresented in both research and commercial product design. Therefore, the overarching aim of this workshop is to increase the momentum for research within the space of hands-free, mobile, and conversational interfaces that centers on age-relevant and inter- and cross-generational interaction. For this, we plan to create an interdisciplinary space that brings together researchers, designers, practitioners, and users, to discuss and share challenges, principles, and strategies for designing such interfaces across the life span. We thus welcome contributions of empirical studies, theories, design, and evaluation of hands-free, mobile, and conversational interfaces designed with aging in mind (e.g. older adults or inter/cross-generational). We particularly encourage contributions focused on leveraging recent advances in generative AI or LLMs. Through this, we aim to grow the community of CUI researchers across disciplinary boundaries (human-computer interaction, voice and language technologies, geronto-technologies, information studies, etc.) that are engaged in the shared goal of ensuring that the aging dimension is appropriately incorporated in mobile / conversational interaction design research."

- title: "Between Trust and Identity: Form, Function, and Presentation"
  datetime: 8th July 2024 (Time TBC)
  organisers: Minha Lee, Donald McMillan, Illaria Torre, Joel Fischer, and Yvon Ruitenburg
  description: In this workshop, we aim to synthesize research goals and methods to further probe the intricacies of identity fragmentation and its implications for user trust in CUIs. To pursue a collaborative debate, we formulate that trust and identity suffer from the chicken or the egg problem--- Should issues surrounding identity be resolved first before trust can even be conceived to be possible between humans and CUIs? Can users truly trust a CUI that lacks a consistent and transparent identity or fails to evolve as its relation with the user develops, and would that trust be different for different embodiments and platforms? We consider that trust itself perhaps should be questioned given that the issues surrounding identity are not resolved. We additionally discuss whether identity across platforms should be uniform to conduce user trust or should adopt distinct personas to engender user confidence and whether the identity should stay consistent over time or evolve with the user as their relationship develops.

- title: "Voicecraft: Designing Task-specific Voice Assistant Personas"
  datetime: 8th July 2024 (Time TBC)
  organisers: Mateusz Dubiel, Smit Desai, Nima Zargham, and Anuschka Schmitt
  description: "Voicecraft workshop aims to establish a research community focused on the design and evaluation of Voice Assistant (VA) personas for both task-oriented functions (e.g., information search, online shopping) and personal growth applications (e.g., coaching, mindful reflection, tutoring). Through discussion and collaborative efforts, we will seek to propose a set of practices and standards that will help to improve the ecological validity of VA personas. In particular, we will explore topics such as the interaction design of voice-based interfaces, the impact of agent personas on the user experience, and the approaches for designing such VA agents. This workshop will serve as a platform to build a better-equipped community to explore VA personas that provide a better fit to range of everyday interaction scenarios."
