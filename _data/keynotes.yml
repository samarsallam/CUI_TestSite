  title: What is AI speech generation currently capable of?
  abstract: >-
    There are a bewildering number of papers being published about synthetic speech generation. Every new paper claims a major advance using yet another new model architecture. I will try to make sense of the landscape, concentrating on what the latest models are capable of.  These models are large, computationally expensive, and are trained on tens of thousands of hours of speech. Fortunately, many are also getting more capable: a single pre-trained model can do several tasks, such as text-to-speech and voice conversion. This might liberate us. Instead of tedious searches for the perfect model, we can instead concentrate on properly defining the problems we want to solve - What exactly is "conversational speech"? What would good cross-lingual prosody transfer sound like? Why do listeners sometimes prefer synthetic speech over natural speech? Does that mean we could generate synthetic speech that users trust more than natural speech?

  title: Responsible Conversational User Interfaces
  abstract: >-
    Responsible AI has been a popular topic in academic and industry settings with the advent of conversational AI based on generative models in the last two years. Despite the growing scientific research in this field, what should be considered when designing for responsibility in conversational AI interactions is still being investigated. In this talk, I will revisit some of the CUI work our community has been publishing in the last six years and my projects in education and finance to unveil the main considered definitions, criteria, and methodologies for designing responsible AI systems. We will discuss responsible AI in public and private settings and human values identified as essential to design responsible CUIs. Our research projects have investigated how to foster trust, accountability, transparency, fairness, and acceptance of conversational user interfaces deployed in natural settings with diverse audiences. Furthermore, we will discuss how bias emerged as a criterion when interacting with CUIs in museum settings, how we investigated accountability and trust embedded into financial advisors’ chatbots, and our recent work into elucidating values such as creditworthiness with micro business women in underrepresented communities using conversational systems. This talk can serve as the basis for further discussions during the conference on promoting social impact and mitigating harm when designing conversational generative systems with responsibility.
